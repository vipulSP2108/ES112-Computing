# Last Person Standing!

In this question, we have a list of numbers in a circular fashion. In each round, we execute the kth person and finally have to report who is the last alive person.

As an example, assume our circular list of numbers is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and k is 2. So, we eliminate every 2nd person.

In the first round, we eliminate number 2. At that stage, we are left with 1, 3, 4, 5.

As we had executed 2 in the previous round, we now execute the 2nd person from 2's original position. This is person 4.

At this stage, we have 1, 3, 5 left.

In the next round, we eliminate the 2nd person from 4's original position which is 1. We are now left with 3, 5.

Now, we eliminate the 2nd person fron 1's original position which is 5.

So, the last person standing is 3

Note: Remember the circular connection -- after the last number we go to the first number.
