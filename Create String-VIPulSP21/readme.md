Note: s has alphabets between b and y or B and Y

Input

First line contains a string.

second line contains operations to be performed on string.

The operations are N and P, where N and P denote next and previous charater in alphabet series respectively. Here o[i] is operated on s[i].

Output

Print the created string on one line

# Example

Input:

>pytHon
>
>NNPNPN

Output

>qzsIno

Explanation

>As o[i] needs to be operated in s[i], N (next character) on p gives q, N on y gives z, P on t gives s, N on H gives I and so on. Thus the result obtained is qzsIno.
