# Instructions

You are given a list of numbers (space separated) to shuffle. Your output should be the shuffled list of numbers. The shuffle array is obtained by dividing the array into two equal halves (first half has one more element if the number of elements is odd.) and alternately putting elements from both arrays in order.

The input

>0 4 1 5 2 6 3 7

and the input

>0 1 2 3 4
