# Rotate

In this question, we either left or right rotate a given set of numbers.

The first line tells whether to right (1) or left rotate (-1). The second line contains the number of places to rotate (positive integer between 1 and n-1). The third line contains a list of (n) comma separated integers. The output is a comma separated list of rotated set of integers.
