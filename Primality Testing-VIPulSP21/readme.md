Instructions

Write two primality testing functions. The first one prime should try each possible non-trivial divisor. The second one fermat should use Fermat's Primality Test.

Benchmark your programs. Choose 100,000 random natural numbers in the range 10 to 1,000,000. How often did Fermat's test give the wrong answer?

Click the "Run" button to see a performance comparison of your two functions.
