Input

First line contains the content of 1st tuple (Space separated)
Second line contains the content of 2nd tuple (Space separated)
Output

Concatenated tuple

NOTE:

Don't remove the existing code
No need to write code for taking input and printing output
Write your code in the function yourCodeHere only
The two input tuples are assigned to tuple1 and tuple2
You must return the resultant tuple otherwise the code will raise error
