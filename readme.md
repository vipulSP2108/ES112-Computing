`Course Description and Topics`

This course is designed to introduce students to programming using Python. The course covers fundamental programming concepts and syntax. It will give hands-on experience in writing Python programs and will be able to apply the skills learned to solve real-world problems.

This repository contains various assignments for the Data-centric Computing course, focused on implementing data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs in python programming languages and using them to solve problems. It also covers popular algorithms, such as sorting, searching and graph traversal.

`Assignments`

Each assignment has its folder with multiple files, including a problem statement and readme file that provides a detailed explanation of the question; it provides an input and output format. An example input is given along with the expected output.
It also includes solutions made by me.
