# Instructions

The Collatz sequence of a positive integer n starts at n. The next number is obtained by following these rules.

If n is 1, stop.
Otherwise if n is odd, then the next number is 3n + 1.
if n is even, then the next number is half of n.
Write a program that takes as input the number n and prints its Collatz sequence separated by space.
