Instructions

Given a list of integers, write a python program to count Even and Odd numbers in a List.

Input

A list of positive integers.

Note: As in the input list will be in the form of string, therefore to convert this string into list of numbers you can use below code

lst = list(map(int, lst_str.split()))
Here, lst is the final list of numbers and "lst_str" is the input list which will be in the form of string.

Output

Count of Even numbers followed by Count of odd numbers separated by a space in between.

Input 1:

>2 7 5 64 14

Output 1:

The input contains three even numbers, i.e. 2, 64, and 14, and two odd numbers, i.e. 7 and 5. Hence output will be 3 2

>3 2

Input 2:

>12 14 95 3

Output 2:

The input contains two even numbers, i.e. 12 and 14, and two odd numbers, i.e. 95 and 3. Hence output will be 2 2

>2 2
